## Introduction

The current tutoring program at our college, designed to facilitate academic support through peer tutoring, faces significant operational challenges due to its reliance on manual processes and email-based coordination. This system, while functional, leads to inefficiencies, delays, and a lack of transparency for both tutors and students seeking assistance. AcademiLink aims to address these issues by introducing a streamlined, automated platform for managing tutoring requests, scheduling, and reporting, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness and accessibility of the tutoring program.

## Description of AcademiLink

AcademiLink offers a comprehensive solution for managing the tutoring process, featuring:

- **For Tutors**: A dashboard to manage course offerings, accept or decline tutoring requests, and submit monthly hours automatically.
- **For Students**: The ability to request tutoring sessions, select from available tutors based on course and timing preferences, and provide feedback.
- **For the Manager**: Tools for overseeing the entire process, including tutor approvals, monitoring session completions, and generating reports.

This platform will utilize modern web technologies to ensure a responsive, user-friendly experience, with a focus on simplicity and efficiency for all users.

## Manual Process Analysis

The current manual system, characterized by its reliance on email communication and manual record-keeping, suffers from several key challenges:

- **Time-consuming coordination**: Matching tutors with students requires significant manual effort from the manager.
- **Limited transparency**: Students and tutors have limited visibility into available times and matching availability.
- **Inefficient tracking**: Reporting and tracking of tutoring hours are prone to errors and omissions.

## Comparison with Existing Tools

### Jet Admin

- **Purpose**: Jet Admin is a no-code platform that allows you to build custom web applications for various business needs without writing any code. It is particularly useful for creating admin panels, internal tools, or CRM systems using your existing data sources like databases, APIs, or third-party apps. Jet Admin offers a drag-and-drop interface, making it accessible for non-developers to create functional applications for data management and operations.

- **Use Case**: Tutors use the platform to register their teaching preferences and log teaching hours. Students browse and request tutoring sessions, while the program manager oversees assignments and monitors submissions.

- **Cons**: Requires additional customization or integration for full functionality, such as automated matching and scheduling.

- **Advantage of AcademiLink**: Provides a seamless, tutoring-specific solution with automatic matching based on preferences and availability, reducing manual work and potential errors.

### Salesforce

- **Purpose**: Salesforce is a powerful cloud-based CRM platform that supports a wide range of business processes, from sales and customer service to marketing automation. It is highly customizable, allowing businesses to tailor the platform to their specific needs through extensive configuration options and a robust development environment. Salesforce also offers a rich ecosystem of apps through its AppExchange for extending functionality.

- **Use Case**: The platform is adapted to manage tutor and student interactions, track tutor availability, and manage hours worked, catering to tutors, students, and the program manager.

- **Cons**: Complex and potentially expensive to customize for specific needs, possibly offering more features than necessary.

- **Advantage of AcademiLink**: Offers a streamlined, cost-effective solution specifically designed for tutoring management, enhancing user experience with focused features.

### Microsoft Teams

- **Purpose**: Microsoft Teams is a collaboration platform that integrates with Microsoft 365. It offers features like chat, video calls, meetings, file storage, and collaboration on Office documents. Teams is designed to facilitate communication and collaboration within organizations, making it a versatile tool for both educational and corporate environments.

- **Use Case**: Tutors and students use Teams for direct communication, session scheduling, and resource sharing, with the program manager overseeing the tutoring program through channel monitoring.

- **Cons**: Lacks specific features for tutor-student pairing, hour tracking, and payment processing.

- **Advantage of AcademiLink**: Provides a dedicated platform for managing all aspects of tutoring services, including features for automatic session requests and hour submissions.

### Google Workspace

- **Purpose**: Google Workspace offers a suite of productivity and collaboration tools that enable real-time document editing, file sharing, and communication.

- **Use Case**: Google Forms is used for registration, Sheets for tracking and scheduling, and Calendar for session management by tutors, students, and the program manager.

- **Cons**: Manual effort is required to cohesively link these tools, and it lacks automatic notification and matching features.

- **Advantage of AcademiLink**: Automates and integrates registration, scheduling, and tracking within a single platform, providing a tailored solution for tutoring management.

### Asana

- **Purpose**: Asana is a project management tool designed to help teams organize, track, and manage their work. With features like tasks, projects, deadlines, and progress tracking, Asana helps teams stay aligned and focused on their goals. It supports various workflows, from simple to-do lists to complex project plans, making it adaptable to different team sizes and project types.

- **Use Case**: The tutoring program is managed as a project, with tutoring requests as tasks assigned to tutors based on availability and expertise. The program manager tracks completion and manages task assignments.

- **Cons**: Not specifically designed for educational tutoring management, requiring significant setup and customization.

- **Advantage of AcademiLink**: Directly addresses tutoring management needs with automated features for session requests, approvals, and hour tracking, offering a more tailored and efficient solution.
